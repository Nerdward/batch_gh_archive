### Problem statement

The Research and Development Team of Github want to know what time of the day
they get more traffic and what resources are not popular enough. They will 
send details to the Marketing Team.

* You have been hired to give insights on Github Developer activity for June 2022.
* Here are some visualizations you need to produce:
  * Traffic per hour
  * Events popularity chart.

For that, you will need:

* Create a pipeline for processing this dataset and putting it to a datalake
* Create a pipeline for moving the data from the lake to a data warehouse
* Transform the data in the data warehouse: prepare it for the dashboard
* Create a dashboard



## Data Pipeline 

The pipeline could be stream or batch: this is the first thing you'll need to decide 

* If you want to run things periodically (e.g. hourly/daily), go with batch


## Technologies 

* Cloud: AWS.
* Infrastructure as code (IaC): Terraform.
* Workflow orchestration: Airflow.
* Data Wareshouse: Redshift.
* Batch processing: Spark.


## Dashboard

You can build a dashboard with any of the tools shown in the course (Data Studio or Metabase) or any other BI tool of your choice. If you do use another tool, please specify and make sure that the dashboard is somehow accessible to your peers. 

Your dashboard should contain at least two tiles, we suggest you include:

- 1 graph that shows the distribution of some categorical data 
- 1 graph that shows the distribution of the data across a temporal line

Make sure that your graph is clear to understand by adding references and titles. 

Example of a dashboard: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4315804/159771458-b924d0c1-91d5-4a8a-8c34-f36c25c31a3c.png)


## Peer review criteria

* Problem description
    * 0 points: Problem is not described
    * 1 point: Problem is described but shortly or not clearly 
    * 2 points: Problem is well described and it's clear what the problem the project solves
* Cloud
    * 0 points: Cloud is not used, things run only locally
    * 2 points: The project is developed on the cloud
    * 4 points: The project is developed on the clound and IaC tools are used
* Data ingestion (choose either batch or stream)
    * Batch / Workflow orchestration
        * 0 points: No workflow orchestration
        * 2 points: Partial workflow orchestration: some steps are orchestrated, some run manually
        * 4 points: End-to-end pipeline: multiple steps in the DAG, uploading data to data lake
    * Stream
        * 0 points: No streaming system (like Kafka, Pulsar, etc)
        * 2 points: A simple pipeline with one consumer and one producer
        * 4 points: Using consumer/producers and streaming technologies (like Kafka streaming, Spark streaming, Flink, etc)
* Data warehouse
    * 0 points: No DWH is used
    * 2 points: Tables are created in DWH, but not optimized
    * 4 points: Tables are partitioned and clustered in a way that makes sense for the upstream queries (with explanation)
* Transformations (dbt, spark, etc)
    * 0 points: No tranformations
    * 2 points: Simple SQL transformation (no dbt or similar tools)
    * 4 points: Tranformations are defined with dbt, Spark or similar technologies
* Dashboard
    * 0 points: No dashboard
    * 2 points: A dashboard with 1 tile
    * 4 points: A dashboard with 2 tiles
* Reproducibility
    * 0 points: No instructions how to run code at all
    * 2 points: Some instructions are there, but they are not complete
    * 4 points: Instructions are clear, it's easy to run the code, and the code works


## Going the extra mile 

If you finish the project and you want to improve it, here are a few things you can do:

* Add tests
* Use make
* Add CI/CD pipeline 

This is not covered in the course and this is entirely optional.

If you plan to use this project as your portfolio project, it'll 
definitely help you to stand out from others.
